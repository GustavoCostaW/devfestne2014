# Fries v2.0.3 [![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/jaunesarmiento/fries/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free "Bitdeli Badge")

Fries is an awesome mobile UI framework for Android apps using just HTML, CSS,
and Javascript and is inspired by [Ratchet].

Aaaaand Fries just got its new home. Check out http://getfri.es/

## Getting Started

* [Download] Fries or clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:jaunesarmiento/fries.git`.
* Head on over to the [documentation] to learn more about Fries' components and how to build your first prototype.
* Check out the [examples] to learn how to piece together each component.

### Using Bower

I'm glad to announce that Fries is also now available as a [Bower] package. To
install Fries using Bower, just run:

```shell
$ bower install fries
```


## Documentation and examples

Fries uses [Jekyll] to run the documentation and examples.

### Running the docs and examples locally
1.  Install [Jekyll]
2.  From the root directory of Fries, run `jekyll serve`
3.  Open `http://localhost:4000/` in your favorite browser to see the documentation or `http://localhost:4000/examples/` for the examples.

__Note:__ You also might want to resize your browser's screen resolutiion and
emulate touch events for a better experience while viewing the examples. To do these:

1. Open Chrome Developer Tools.
2. Go to settings by clicking the little gear icon at the bottom right of the
   window.
3. Go to Overrides tab.
4. Check the "Device metrics" and enter your desired screen resolution. 380x640
   works like a charm.
5. Then check "Emulate touch events" and that's it.
